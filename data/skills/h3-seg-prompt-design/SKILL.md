description: Design long-form H3 video projects as 5–15 second generation segments, including inspiration, locked reference-asset mapping, storyboard continuity, dialogue and voiceover, and H3-compliant per-segment prompts. Use when a user wants segmented H3 prompts or a long video planned for repeated H3 generation; do not use for unrelated video models or ordinary prose scripts.

# H3 Segmented Prompt Design

Create a complete, locally organized H3 long-video prompt package without expanding the user's reference-asset set.

## Required reading

Before acting, read [references/workflow-rules.md](references/workflow-rules.md) completely.

For every H3 prompt-writing task, also read [references/h3-base-guide.md](references/h3-base-guide.md) completely. If any reference image, video, audio, keyframe, reusable subject, or source-media relationship is involved, also read [references/h3-full-reference-guide.md](references/h3-full-reference-guide.md) completely.

## Core workflow

1. If the user has no concrete concept, offer several distinct, segment-friendly ideas. Do not create a project folder until a theme is selected.
2. Once a theme or rough concept exists, create a folder named after the video theme inside the active workspace. Preserve any existing content if the folder already exists.
3. Confirm the complete reference-asset set with the user. Assign unique, easy aliases and create `素材映射.md`. Paths may remain empty, but every planned asset needs a textual description and role.
4. Treat the confirmed asset list as locked. Never add a generated segment, preceding clip, tail frame, companion audio, or inferred asset unless the user explicitly adds it.
5. Expand the idea into 5–15 second generation segments and write `分镜设计.md`. Estimate duration from visible action, dialogue, and camera motion. Mark a continuing segment only as `（接续分镜NN）`.
6. After storyboard approval, write `H3分镜提示词.md`. Select the base or full-reference structure per segment and follow the official guide fields, language rules, timing, speakers, soundscape, and music rules.
7. Run `scripts/validate_project.py` against the video folder, resolve all errors, and report any warnings that require user judgment.

## Non-negotiable invariants

- One H3 generation segment lasts from 5 through 15 seconds inclusive.
- Per segment, use no more than 9 reference images, 3 reference videos, and 3 reference audio tracks. A reference video's companion audio counts independently when explicitly enabled.
- Asset citations use `{{ref:别名}}`; companion audio uses `{{ref:别名.audio}}`.
- `<Subject N>` is not an asset citation and must never be replaced by `{{ref:...}}`.
- Decide `<Subject N>` from the actual reusable visible content in that project and segment. Scene references such as streets or shops normally remain direct environment references; do not mechanically turn every asset into a Subject.
- Keep recurring Subject numbers and speaker IDs stable across the whole project. Unused numbers may be absent from an individual segment.
- A continuation marker describes narrative continuity only. It never authorizes a new asset or a `{{ref:分镜NN成片}}` citation.
- Write prompt sections in English. Preserve original language only inside `<d>` for dialogue or lyrics and for visible on-screen text.
- Do not invent legible on-screen text when the user requests none.
- Do not begin final prompt authoring before the user has confirmed the storyboard direction.
