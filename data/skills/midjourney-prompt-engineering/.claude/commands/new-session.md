# New Session

Start a new prompt engineering session with full knowledge application.

## Instructions

0. **Verify database access.** Run `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sessions` via sqlite MCP. If the query fails, tell the user: "Database not available. The `sqlite` MCP server (dbhub) should already be configured in Codex; verify it is running, then retry." Do not proceed without database access.

1. **Gather the user's intent:**
   - What are they trying to create?
   - Do they have a reference image? They can share the image, describe it in text, or both.
   - Any specific requirements (aspect ratio, style, mood, use case)?

2. **Check for unreflected sessions** before starting new work:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, intent, total_iterations, status
   FROM sessions
   WHERE status IN ('success', 'abandoned') AND reflected = 0
   ```

   If any unreflected sessions exist:
   - For each, run the lightweight reflection extraction (see "Session Lifecycle & Automatic Reflection" in `rules/learn-reflection.md`)
   - Mark each session as `reflected = 1`
   - Briefly inform the user: "Extracted patterns from N previous session(s) before starting."

   Also check for sessions left in 'active' status that aren't the current one:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, intent, total_iterations FROM sessions WHERE status = 'active'
   ```
   If found, ask the user: should these be marked as abandoned (triggers reflection) or are they still in progress?

3. **Analyze the reference — image(s), text, or both:**

   **If the user shares a single reference image:**
   - Look at it and produce the full reference analysis: subject, lighting (type, key light, fill, rim, atmosphere), colors (palette, temperature, saturation), material/texture, composition (framing, subject position, depth, negative space), mood, style, render quality.
   - Think about it from a prompt-engineering perspective: what makes this image look this way, what would be hardest to reproduce in MJ, what could MJ misinterpret, and what keywords map to each visual quality.
   - Map visual qualities to prompt language using the keyword effectiveness database.
   - Present your analysis to the user. Let them correct, confirm, or add context that the image alone doesn't convey.

   **If the user shares multiple reference images:**
   - Analyze **each image individually** using the full 7-element framework (see `rules/core-reference-analysis.md`).
   - Then identify **shared vs variable qualities** across all images:
     - **Shared qualities** (appear in all/most images) define the target aesthetic.
     - **Variable qualities** (differ across images) are subject-dependent, not style-defining.
   - Build a **composite `reference_analysis`** JSON with `source_count`, `shared_defining_qualities`, `variable_qualities`, and `per_image_notes` (see the Composite Reference Analysis section in `rules/core-reference-analysis.md`).
   - Present the composite to the user. Highlight what you classified as shared vs variable and let them correct the classification.

   **If the user provides a text description:**
   - Analyze it using the Reference Analysis Template from `rules/core-reference-analysis.md`. Extract what you can. Ask about genuinely ambiguous aspects only.

   **If both image(s) and text are provided:**
   - Combine them. The images show what words may not capture; the description reveals intent the images alone don't convey. Note any contradictions and ask the user to clarify.

4. **Decide how to use the reference image in MJ (if an image was provided).**
   Evaluate and recommend one of these approaches — ask the user which they prefer:

   - **`--sref <image_URL>` (style reference from image):** Match the aesthetic, color palette, mood, or rendering style — but with a different subject. Best when the user wants "this vibe" applied to something else. **Supports multiple URLs** (space-separated) to blend styles from several references.
   - **`--sref <code>` (style reference from code):** Apply a predefined aesthetic from MJ's style library using a numeric code. Best when the user found a style they like on the Style Explorer (`midjourney.com/explore?tab=styles`), wants a reproducible aesthetic without a reference image, or wants to blend multiple curated styles with weighted ratios (`--sref code1::3 code2::1`). Also supports `--sref random` for discovery. See `rules/core-prompt-construction.md` "Style Codes" section.
   - **`--iref` (image reference):** Use as compositional or structural inspiration. Best when the user wants "something that looks like this."
   - **`--oref` (object reference, V7):** Maintain a consistent character or object across generations. (Replaces `--cref` from V6.)
   - **Prompt-only recreation:** Reverse-engineer the look through keywords alone. Harder, but produces transferable knowledge — the prompt works without the reference. Best for learning what keywords produce specific effects.
   - **Hybrid:** Use a reference parameter for the hardest-to-describe qualities while prompting explicitly for everything else. Log which aspects came from the reference param vs. the prompt. Can combine image URLs with style codes (e.g., `--sref <image_URL> 1225796221`).

   Log the chosen approach in the session data. This distinction matters for pattern extraction during reflection.

   **Also capture the approach rationale — learning vs. efficiency:**
   - **Learning mode:** Prompt-only or minimal reference use. Goal is to discover which keywords/techniques produce specific effects. Scores may be lower than necessary because the user is intentionally avoiding shortcuts. Reflection should weight keyword data heavily from these sessions.
   - **Efficiency mode:** Use all available tools (--iref, --sref, --oref) to get the best result fastest. Scores reflect tool-assisted quality. Reflection should focus on which reference parameters worked, not keyword discovery.
   - **Hybrid:** Some aspects learned through prompt, others assisted by references. Log which is which.

   Store the rationale:
   ```sql
   UPDATE sessions SET approach_rationale = ? WHERE id = ?
   ```

5. **Apply knowledge before constructing the prompt:**
   - Identify relevant categories from the analysis
   - Query all active patterns (including low-confidence auto-extracted):
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM patterns WHERE is_active = 1
     ORDER BY
       CASE confidence WHEN 'high' THEN 1 WHEN 'medium' THEN 2 WHEN 'low' THEN 3 END,
       success_rate DESC
     ```
   - **Score each pattern for relevance** to this specific task (not just category match):
     - Does the pattern's problem description match the current situation?
     - If the pattern has conditional notes from contrastive refinement (e.g., "works when X but not when Y"), does the current task match the success conditions?
     - Is the specificity level appropriate? (universal always applies; specific only when exact context matches)
     - When was it last validated and for which MJ version?
   - Organize patterns into tiers:
     - **Strong matches** (high confidence, reviewed)
     - **Likely relevant** (medium confidence)
     - **Worth trying** (low confidence, auto-extracted — flag as "from recent sessions, limited evidence")
     - **Anti-patterns to avoid**
   - Check keyword effectiveness for descriptors you're considering:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM keyword_effectiveness WHERE effectiveness IN ('excellent', 'good') ORDER BY effectiveness DESC
     ```
   - Check failure modes to avoid: read `knowledge/failure-modes.md`
   - Look for similar successful sessions:
     ```sql
     SELECT id, intent, final_successful_prompt, reference_analysis FROM sessions WHERE status = 'success'
     ```

5.5. **Assess knowledge coverage and research if needed** (Phase: Testing):

   After applying knowledge (step 5), assess how much internal coverage exists for this intent.

   a. **Calculate coverage score** from step 5 results:

      | Signal | Weight | Calculation |
      |--------|--------|-------------|
      | Pattern matches | 0.40 | `min(1.0, (strong_matches * 3 + likely_relevant * 2 + worth_trying) / 6)` |
      | Keyword data | 0.30 | `descriptors_with_good_data / total_key_descriptors` (from keyword_effectiveness query) |
      | Similar sessions | 0.30 | `min(1.0, similar_successful_sessions / 2)` |

      Overall = weighted sum of the three signals.

   b. **Present coverage assessment** to the user (always, even when high):
      ```
      Knowledge Coverage: [score] ([high/medium/low])
      - Patterns: [N strong, N likely, N worth trying]
      - Keywords: [N/M descriptors have effectiveness data]
      - Similar sessions: [N successful sessions with related intent]
      ```

   c. **If coverage < 0.3**, run community research:
      - Construct 3-5 targeted search queries from intent and gap categories:
        1. Core technique: `"midjourney v7" "{primary_concept}" prompt`
        2. Reddit community: `site:reddit.com/r/midjourney "{concept}" tips`
        3. Failure-specific: `"midjourney" "{hard_aspect}" how to`
        4. Parameter-specific: `"midjourney v7" --style raw "{concept}"`
        5. Prompt examples: `"midjourney prompt" "{concept}" example`
      - Use WebSearch for up to 3 queries, WebFetch for top 2 result pages
      - **Budget:** max 3 searches + 2 page fetches (~30s wall time)
      - **Extraction prompt for WebFetch:** "Extract Midjourney prompt techniques for [CONCEPT]. For each: specific keywords, parameters, source context, caveats. Focus on actionable V7 techniques, ignore general advice."
      - Synthesize findings into structured format:
        ```
        Community Research Findings (unvalidated):

        1. TECHNIQUE: [name]
           Keywords: [specific keywords to try]
           Parameters: [if any]
           Source: [where found]
           Relevance: [how this addresses the gap]
        ```
      - Present findings clearly labeled as **"Community Research (unvalidated)"** — separate from internal knowledge which is "battle-tested" (has logged evidence)

   d. **Tag session** as research-assisted (after session is created in step 6):
      ```sql
      UPDATE sessions SET tags = json_insert(COALESCE(tags, '[]'), '$[#]', 'research-assisted') WHERE id = ?
      ```
      Append to approach_rationale:
      ```sql
      UPDATE sessions SET approach_rationale = COALESCE(approach_rationale, '') || ' | Research-assisted: coverage=' || ? WHERE id = ?
      ```

   e. **If coverage >= 0.3**, skip research. User can trigger `/research` mid-session if needed.

   f. **In prompt construction (step 7)**: internal knowledge forms the backbone, research findings are layered as experimental additions. Each element should be annotated with its source (internal pattern vs. community research).

6. **Create the session in the database:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO sessions (id, intent, reference_description, reference_analysis, status)
   VALUES (lower(hex(randomblob(4)) || '-' || hex(randomblob(2)) || '-' || hex(randomblob(2)) || '-' || hex(randomblob(2)) || '-' || hex(randomblob(6))), ?, ?, ?, 'active')
   ```

6.5. **Create session directory and persist reference image(s):**

   a. Create the session directory structure:
      ```bash
      mkdir -p sessions/{session_id_first_8_chars}
      ```

   b. **If reference image(s) were provided**, persist them to the session directory using numbered filenames (`reference-1.png`, `reference-2.png`, etc.):

      For **each** reference image:
      - If the user provided a **stable file path** (e.g., `~/Downloads/ref.png` or `reference-images/radiant.png`), copy it:
        ```bash
        cp /path/to/user/image.png sessions/{id}/reference-1.png
        cp /path/to/user/image2.png sessions/{id}/reference-2.png
        ```
      - If the user **pasted/dropped an image into the terminal**, you can see and analyze it — but the source file is a macOS temp path that disappears almost immediately. You **cannot** copy it. Instead:
        1. Analyze the image immediately (you can see it)
        2. Ask the user to save the image to a stable location: `reference-images/` or directly to `sessions/{id}/reference-N.png`
        3. Once they confirm the path, copy it to the session directory
      - If a **URL** was provided, download it:
        ```bash
        curl -o sessions/{id}/reference-1.png <url>
        ```

      **Recommended workflow:** Ask users to save reference images to `reference-images/` before starting. This avoids temp-file issues and keeps originals accessible across sessions.

   c. Update the database with reference path(s) as a **JSON array**:
      ```sql
      -- Single image:
      UPDATE sessions SET reference_image_path = '["sessions/{id}/reference-1.png"]' WHERE id = ?

      -- Multiple images:
      UPDATE sessions SET reference_image_path = '["sessions/{id}/reference-1.png","sessions/{id}/reference-2.png"]' WHERE id = ?
      ```

   d. If no reference images are available, that's fine — scoring falls back to the
      text-based `reference_analysis` field. But note in the session that visual
      comparison is not available.

7. **Construct the initial prompt** applying all relevant knowledge. Explain your reasoning:
   - Which patterns are being applied and why, with their relevance tier (strong match / likely relevant / worth trying)
   - Which keywords were chosen based on effectiveness data
   - What failure modes you're avoiding, especially those whose trigger conditions overlap with this task
   - Parameter choices and rationale
   - Any conditional constraints from contrastive refinement ("using X because the subject is organic; would use Y instead if metallic")

8. **Log patterns applied:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO session_patterns_applied (session_id, pattern_id) VALUES (?, ?)
   ```

9. **Present the prompt** to the user with:
   - The full prompt ready to paste into Midjourney
   - A breakdown of why each part was chosen
   - Parameter recommendations
   - Things to watch for in the output (likely failure points based on patterns)
   - Suggested variations if the first attempt doesn't work
   - **If research-assisted:** a separate section showing which prompt elements came from community research vs. internal knowledge, so the user knows which parts are experimental

10. **Offer browser automation** (if Playwright MCP is available):
   Ask the user if they'd like you to submit the prompt directly to Midjourney via browser automation.

   **If yes:**
   - Navigate to midjourney.com (check if already there)
   - Check authentication state — if not logged in, ask the user to log in manually (cookies persist after first login)
   - **Disable personalization** — V7 has personalization ON by default. Check the toggle near the Imagine bar and turn it OFF for reproducible results (see `rules/auto-core-workflows.md` step 1.5). If the user explicitly wants personalization on, skip this and log `personalization=on` in `approach_rationale`.
   - Locate the prompt input field using the selector strategy: `data-testid` > ARIA labels > text content > semantic elements > CSS classes
   - Submit the prompt
   - **Use smart generation polling** via `browser_run_code` (see `rules/auto-core-workflows.md` "Wait for Generation") to efficiently wait for completion without consuming context on repeated DOM snapshots
   - **Use batch image capture** via `browser_run_code` (see `rules/auto-core-workflows.md` "Capture Results") to capture all 4 images in a single tool call, saving ~40-50% context per iteration
   - Analyze all 4 images against the session intent using the **7 standard scoring dimensions** (subject, lighting, color, mood, composition, material, spatial) — see `rules/core-assessment-scoring.md`:
     - Score every dimension for every image. Flag low-confidence dimensions.
     - Identify the best candidate and explain why
     - Note consistency patterns across all 4 (if all miss the same thing, it's a prompt issue)
     - Note divergences (if only some miss, it's MJ interpretation variance)
   - **Present scores as PRELIMINARY** — ask user to validate before logging, especially low-confidence dimensions
   - Recommend next action using the Iteration Action Decision Framework (see `rules/core-iteration-framework.md`): Upscale best, Vary (specify image), or prompt edit
   - If the user approves an action, perform it via browser automation

   **If no:**
   - Tell the user to paste the prompt into Midjourney and share the output image when ready

11. **After generation results** (whether via browser automation or user-shared image):
    - Your visual analysis of the output against the reference/intent produces the richest iteration data
    - Automatically log the iteration using the `/log-iteration` workflow — set `action_type = 'initial'` for the first generation
    - **Spatial assessment check:** If the reference or intent involves floating, levitation, unusual grounding, or surreal physics, explicitly ask the user to validate your spatial scoring (see "Known Agent Limitations" in `rules/core-assessment-scoring.md`)
    - Propose next steps based on the gap analysis, using the Iteration Action Decision Framework from `rules/core-iteration-framework.md` to recommend the appropriate action type (Vary vs. prompt edit)
